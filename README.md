Sliding-Block-Puzzle
=================

Description
------------
Uses Artificial Intelligence algorithms to solve a Sliding Block Puzzle <br />
You can find an example of these types of puzzles at the following link:

AI Algorithms
--------
This code supports the use of the following algorithms:

  - Random Walk
  - Breadth First Search
  - Depth First Search
  - Iterative Deepening Search
  - A* with Manhattan Distance
  - A* with a modified Manhattan Distance

The modified Manhattan Distance calculates the Manhattan Distance then<br />
adds the number of adjacent blocks to the master block.  This heuristic is<br />
both dominating of pure Manhattan Distance and is admissible.

Usage
--------
Update for Makefile instructions coming soon.
Need to improve Makefile to allow for proper execution.
